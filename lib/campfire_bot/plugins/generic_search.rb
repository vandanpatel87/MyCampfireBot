#
# Search sites like Google and Wikipedia
#
# You configure the command name and URL pattern.  Given a search
# term, it attempts to respond with the URL of the first search
# result.  It does so by simply inserting the term into the URL at the
# '%s'.  If the url redirects, it responds with the redirect target
# instead, so you get a hint about what you'll see.  Otherwise, you
# get just the expanded url pattern.
#
# This is useful for a wide range of sites.  Sample config:
#
# generic_search_commands:
#   wikipedia: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s&go=Go"
#   google: "http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%s&btnI=I'm+Feeling+Lucky&aq=f&oq="
#   php: "http://us3.php.net/manual-lookup.php?pattern=%s&lang=en"
#   letmegooglethatforyou: "http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=%s"
#
# Note that the last site never redirects, which is fine.
